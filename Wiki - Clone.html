      <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian
      professional cricketer who plays as a right-handed batter and a
      wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeper
      batsmen and captains and one of the greatest ODI batsmen, he represented
      the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side in limited overs
      formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has
      captained the most international matches and is the most successful Indian
      captain. He has led India to victory in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the
      2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, being the only
      captain to win three different limited overs ICC tournaments. He also led
      the teams that won the Asia Cup in 2010, 2016 and was a member of the
      title winning squad in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999. He
      made his debut for the Indian cricket team on 23 December 2004 in an ODI
      against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later against Sri
      Lanka. In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over
      in all formats by 2008. Dhoni retired from test cricket in 2014 but
      continued playing in limited overs cricket till 2019. He has scored 17,266
      runs in international cricket including 10,000 plus runs at an average of
      more than 50 in ODIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Dhoni plays for Chennai Super Kings
      (CSK), leading them to the final on ten occasions and winning it five
      times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 ) jointly sharing this title with
      Rohit Sharma . He has also led CSK to two Champions League T20 titles in
      2010 and 2014. Dhoni is among the few batsmen to have scored more than
      five thousand runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      n 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honour Major Dhyan Chand
      Khel Ratna Award by Government of India. He received the fourth highest
      civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third highest civilian award Padma
      Bhushan in 2018. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant colonel in the
      Parachute Regiment of the Indian Territorial Army which was presented to
      him by the Indian Army in 2011. In June 2025, he was inducted into ICC
      Cricket Hall of Fame.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a
      Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. <sup>[3]</sup
      ><sup>[4]</sup> His parents hailed from Lwali village in Uttar Pradesh
      (now Uttarakhand) and he was the youngest of three children. <sup>[5]</sup
      ><sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> His family spells the surname as "Dhauni".
      <sup>[8]</sup> The spelling "Dhoni" emerged due to a spelling mistake in
      his school certificates and, despite repeated attempts by his family, has
      never been rectified. <sup>[9]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dhoni did his schooling from DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, where he started
      playing football as a goalkeeper, but later moved to play cricket on the
      suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee. <sup>[10]</sup
      ><sup>[11]</sup> From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket
      Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur under South Eastern Railway zone of Indian
      Railways. <sup>[12]</sup><sup>[13]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Youth career</h2>
    <p>
      He played as a wicket-keeper for Commando cricket club from 1995 to 1998
      and Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team in 1998.<sup>[14]</sup> At CCL,
      he batted higher up the order and helped the team qualify to the higher
      division. <sup>[15]</sup> Based on his performance at club cricket, he was
      picked for the 1997/98 season of Vinoo Mankad Trophy under-16
      championship. <sup>[16]</sup><sup>[17]</sup> In the 1998-99, Dhoni played
      for Bihar U-19 team in the Cooch Behar Trophy and scored 176 runs in 5
      matches. In the 1999-2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team
      made it to the finals, where Dhoni made 84 in a losing cause.
      <sup>[18]</sup> Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs
      in nine matches with five fifties, 17 catches and seven stumpings.
      <sup>[19]</sup> Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the C. K.
      Nayudu Trophy in the 1999-2000 season and scored only 97 runs in four
      matches, as East Zone lost all the matches and finished last in the
      tournament. <sup>[20]</sup><sup>[21]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar against Assam in the 1999-2000
      season, as an eighteen-year-old scoring 68 runs in the second innings.
      <sup>[22]</sup> Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches.
      Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar
      against Bengal in the 2000-01 Ranji Trophy season. <sup>[23]</sup> Apart
      from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season did not include
      another score over fifty and in the 2001-02 Ranji Trophy season, he scored
      just five fifties in four Ranji matches. <sup>[24]</sup
      ><sup>[25]</sup> Dhoni played for Jharkhand in the 2002-03 Ranji Trophy
      and represented East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy where he started gaining
      recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting
      batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*)
      against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament and was part
      of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy, scoring 244 runs in
      four matches. <sup>[26]</sup><sup>[27]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni represented East Zone and scored a
      fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause.
      <sup>[28]</sup> Dhoni was identified as one of the emerging talents via
      the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW. <sup>[29]</sup
      ><sup>[30]</sup> In 2004, Dhoni was picked for the India A squad for a
      tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. <sup>[31]</sup> Against the Zimbabwe XI in
      Harare Sports Club, Dhoni contributed seven catches and four stumpings.
      <sup>[32]</sup> In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and
      Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against
      Pakistan A with a half-century and scored 362 runs in six innings at an
      average of 72.40 with back to back centuries. <sup>[33]</sup
      ><sup>[34]</sup><sup>[35]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>International career</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Debut and early years</h3>
    <p>
      The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the
      wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting
      talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and
      Dinesh Karthik. <sup>[36]</sup> With Dhoni performing well for the India A
      squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December
      2004. <sup>[37]</sup> Dhoni made his debut in the first match of the
      series and was run out for a duck. <sup>[38]</sup> Dhoni was picked for
      the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan. <sup>[39]</sup> In the second
      match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day
      international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which surpassed the
      earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.
      <sup>[40]</sup> Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in
      October-November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in
      the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145
      balls, winning the game for India. <sup>[41]</sup> The innings would
      surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian
      wicket-keeper and was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet
      anything but crude'. <sup>[42]</sup> It was also the highest individual
      score in ODI cricket in a run chase, a record which was broken seven years
      later by Shane Watson. <sup>[43]</sup><sup>[44]</sup> Dhoni ended the
      series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of
      the series.
      <sup>[45]</sup>

      />
      Dhoni became a regular in the Indian side after the home series against
      South Africa in November 2005. <sup>[46]</sup> In December 2005, Dhoni was
      awarded a "B" grade contract by the BCCI. <sup>[47]</sup> Dhoni made his
      test debut in the same month against Sri Lanka during their tour of India
      at Chennai. <sup>[48]</sup><sup>[49]</sup> Dhoni scored 30 runs in his
      debut match, that was marred by rain and ended in a draw.
      <sup>[50]</sup> Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second test
      leading to an Indian win. <sup>[51]</sup> Dhoni played all the matches in
      the subsequent tour of Pakistan scoring 219 runs in five ODI matches and
      179 runs in five tests including his maiden test century in the second
      test in Faisalabad. <sup>[52]</sup> He scored 106 runs across three tests
      in the home series against England in March 2006 and 177 runs in five ODI
      series that followed. <sup>[52]</sup><sup>[46]</sup> Dhoni dropped
      multiple catches and missed dismissal chances including a key stumping
      opportunity of Andrew Flintoff which led to criticism of his
      wicket-keeping. <sup>[53]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the DLF Cup 2006-07, Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in
      three games and did not qualify for the finals. In the 2006 ICC Champions
      Trophy, India lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a
      half-century against West Indies and failed to make it to the knock out
      stage. <sup>[54]</sup> In the ODI series in South Africa in November 2006,
      Dhoni scored 139 runs in four matches in the series loss.
      <sup>[46]</sup> In the test series that followed, Dhoni scored 114 runs in
      two tests including a first test victory in South Africa in the first
      test, but was ruled out of the third test with injury.
      <sup>[55]</sup> Dhoni made his T20 international debut in December 2006
      against South Africa at Johannesburg. <sup>[56]</sup> Dhoni was
      subsequently named in the ODI team of the year by the ICC for 2006.
      <sup>[57]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>2007 World T20 and captaincy</h3>
    <p>
      India recorded identical 3-1 victory over West Indies and Sri Lanka in
      early 2007 with Dhoni averaging more than 100 in both the series.
      Subsequently, Dhoni was part of the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup
      in which India unexpectedly crashed out in the group stage after losses to
      Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with Dhoni scoring ducks in both these matches
      and just 29 runs in the tournament.<sup>[46]</sup><sup>[58]</sup> As a
      result, Dhoni's house in Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by activists of
      JMM and security was tightened for his family.<sup>[59]</sup> Dhoni scored
      91* against Bangladesh in the first match of the ODI series in May 2007
      which got him the Man of the Match award while also later winning the Man
      of the Series award after the third game of the series was washed
      away.<sup>[60]</sup> Dhoni played for ACC Asia XI cricket team in the
      Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in three matches at an average of 87
      including 139 off 97 balls in the third ODI.<sup>[61]</sup> Dhoni was
      named vice-captain of the ODI team for the 2007 Future Cup against South
      Africa in Ireland and the subsequent seven-match series against
      England.<sup>[62]</sup> Dhoni was awarded an 'A' grade contract by BCCI in
      June 2007.<sup>[63]</sup> Dhoni was appointed as the captain of the Indian
      squad for the inaugural World Twenty20 in September 2007.<sup>[64]</sup>
      Dhoni led India to victory in the tournament after defeating Pakistan in
      the final.<sup>[65]</sup><sup>[66]</sup> Dhoni was later appointed as the
      captain of the Indian cricket team in all formats.<sup>[67]</sup> On 2
      September 2007, Dhoni equalled Adam Gilchrist's international record for
      the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by effecting six dismissals
      against England.<sup>[68]</sup> Dhoni took his first and only wicket in
      international cricket on 30 September 2009 when he bowled Travis Dowlin of
      West Indies in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy.<sup>[69]</sup> However, he
      scored just three runs in the only match he batted with India crashing out
      of the series in the group stage after the match against Australia was
      washed out.<sup>[70]</sup> Dhoni averaged more than 60 in the 2008-09
      season.<sup>[71]</sup> Dhoni scored two centuries during Sri Lanka's tour
      of India in November 2009 which India won to achieve the top ranking in
      ICC test ranking for the first time in its history.<sup>[72]</sup> Dhoni
      had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24
      innings, at an average of 70.43 and topped the ICC ODI batsman rankings
      for several months.<sup>[73]</sup> He was named as the captain and
      wicket-keeper of the ICC ODI Team of the year.<sup>[74]</sup>

      Dhoni led the Indian squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup co-hosted by
      India.<sup>[75]</sup> India won its second ever ODI world cup after
      defeating Sri Lanka in the final with Dhoni being named man of the match
      for scoring an unbeaten 91.<sup>[76]</sup> In December 2012, Pakistan
      toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years and
      Dhoni top-scored in all the three matches of the series with a century in
      the first ODI at Chennai.<sup>[77]</sup> Dhoni led India to victory in the
      2013 ICC Champions Trophy and became the first and the only captain in
      international cricket to claim all ICC limited overs trophies. In the
      rain-shortened final against England, India won by five runs on DLS method
      though Dhoni himself was out for a duck.<sup>[78]</sup> He was also named
      as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the
      ICC.<sup>[79]</sup>Dhoni led the Indian squad for the 2011 Cricket World
      Cup co-hosted by India.<sup>[75]</sup> India won its second ever ODI world
      cup after defeating Sri Lanka in the final with Dhoni being named man of

      />
      After the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation
      tournament against the hosts and Sri Lanka.<sup>[80]</sup> Dhoni got
      injured at the start of the tournament thus ruling him out for most of the
      tournament. He returned to play the final where he was adjudged Man of the
      match for scoring 45 runs off 52 balls including 16 runs in the final over
      to take India to victory by one wicket.<sup>[81]</sup> In November 2013,
      Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate
      more than thousand runs in ODIs against Australia.<sup>[82]</sup> India
      toured South Africa and New Zealand in the 2013-14 season. Though Dhoni
      scored 84 runs at an average of 48 including one half-century against
      South Africa and 272 runs with three consecutive 50-plus scores against
      New Zealand, India lost both the series.<sup>[46]</sup> Dhoni himself
      reached 8000 runs in ODI in the series against New Zealand.<sup>[83]</sup>
      Dhoni led India in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 where India finished as
      runners-up after losing to Sri Lanka in the final.<sup>[84]</sup> He was
      named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the
      ICC.<sup>[85]</sup> India won the away ODI series in England in 2014 and
      series against West Indies in India where Dhoni scored 146 runs across the
      five innings he batted.<sup>[86]</sup><sup>[46]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Test retirement and 2015 World cup</h3>
    <p>
      Dhoni played his last series during India's tour of Australia in December
      2014. Following the third Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his
      retirement from the format.<sup>[87]</sup> In his last test, he effected
      nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went
      past Kumar Sangakkara's record for most stumpings in international cricket
      and also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an
      Indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018.<sup
        >[88]</sup
      ><sup>[89]</sup> In the Carlton Mid triangular series in Australia, India
      failed to win a single match with Dhoni himself managing just 70 runs from
      three innings at an average of 23.34.<sup>[90]</sup> During the 2015
      Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group
      stage matches in a world cup.<sup>[91]</sup> In the match against Zimbabwe
      at Auckland, he made 85 which was the highest score by an Indian captain
      in New Zealand. After beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became
      the third overall and the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI
      matches.<sup>[92]</sup> India lost to eventual champions Australia in the
      semi-finals with Dhoni having a good series, scoring 237 runs in six
      innings at an average of 59.25 and a strike rate of 102.15, and thus,
      becoming the second Indian captain to have an average over 50 and strike
      rate over 100 in a particular season of the World Cup.<sup>[93]</sup
      ><sup>[94]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Final years and retirement</h3>
    <p>
      Dhoni led India to victory in the 2016 Asia Cup, where India remained
      unbeaten.<sup>[95]</sup> Dhoni stepped down as the captain of India in
      January 2017, ahead of the ODI series at home against England.<sup
        >[96]</sup
      >
      In the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, his tenth
      century in ODIs and his first in over three years.<sup>[97]</sup> He was
      named as a wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 ICC
      Champions Trophy in which India finished as runners-up.<sup>[98]</sup
      ><sup>[99]</sup> In August 2017, during the fifth and final ODI against
      Sri Lanka in Colombo, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100
      stumpings in ODIs when he stumped Akila Dananjaya off Yuzvendra
      Chahal.<sup>[100]</sup> He reached the milestone of effecting 400
      dismissals in ODIs in February 2018, following the stumping of Aiden
      Markram in the third ODI of the South Africa tour.<sup>[101]</sup> Though,
      he had a relatively mediocre series scoring 79 runs in two innings at a
      strike rate of 63.20 during India's 2018 tour of England, he went past
      10,000 ODI runs, becoming the fourth Indian and twelfth overall to do
      so.<sup>[102]</sup><sup>[103]</sup><sup>[104]</sup> In the 2018 Asia Cup
      title winning campaign, he scored just 77 runs in four innings at an
      average of 19.25.<sup>[105]</sup><sup>[106]</sup> While captaining in the
      group stage match against Afghanistan due to regular captain Rohit Sharma
      being unavailable, Dhoni became the first cricketer to lead India 200
      times in ODIs.<sup>[107]</sup> Dhoni aggregated 50 runs from three innings
      in the home series against West Indies.<sup>[108]</sup><sup>[109]</sup> In
      the series, he effected the fastest stumping in the history of cricket,
      clocked at 0.08 seconds, when dismissing Keemo Paul.<sup>[110]</sup
      ><sup>[111]</sup> Dhoni was not selected for the T20I squad for the series
      that followed and the Australia tour later that season.<sup>[112]</sup>
      However, he was included in the squad for the ODI series in Australia.<sup

    <hr />
    <p>
      Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper.<sup>[119]</sup> Dhoni
      is an unorthodox batsman who deviates from conventional coaching manuals
      to showcase his batting technique.<sup>[168]</sup> Dhoni displays a
      proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on,
      Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover
      region.<sup>[168]</sup> He plays pull shots and hook shots off
      short-pitched deliveries often putting pressure on the bowler to adjust
      their line and length accordingly. Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at
      the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to
      clear the boundary.<sup>[169]</sup> He is a powerful hitter of the ball
      and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.<sup
        >[170]</sup
      >
      He plays the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by a fellow player
      and childhood friend Santosh Lal.<sup>[171]</sup><sup>[172]</sup
      ><sup>[173]</sup> As a batsman, he is recognised for his finishing skills
      in high-pressure situations.<sup>[174]</sup>
